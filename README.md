# Semester Countdown

Semester Countdown is a simple web application that displays the time remaining until the end of the current semester. The main section features a battery-like bar that fills up as the semester progresses. The application also provides an overview of the remaining months, weeks, days, and working days until the semester ends.

The idea was to make a countdown that you could easily embed into Notion and similar applications!
